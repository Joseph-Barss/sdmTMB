\title{Perform stacking with log scores on \code{sdmTMB_cv()} output}
\usage{
sdmTMB_stacking(model_list, include_folds = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{A list of models fit with \code{\link[=sdmTMB_cv]{sdmTMB_cv()}} to generate
estimates of predictive densities. You will want to set the seed
to the same value before fitting each model or manually construct
the fold IDs so that they are the same across models.}

\item{include_folds}{An optional numeric vector specifying which folds to
include in the calculations. For example, if 5 folds are used for k-fold
cross validation, and the first 4 are needed to generate these weights,
\code{include_folds = 1:4}.}
}
\value{
A vector of model weights.
}

This approach is described in Yao et al. 2018, Bayesian Analysis. The general
method minimizes (or maximizes) some quantity across models. For simple
models with normal error, this may be the root mean squared error (RMSE), but
other approaches include the log score. We adopt the latter here, where log
scores are used to generate the stacking of predictive distributions
