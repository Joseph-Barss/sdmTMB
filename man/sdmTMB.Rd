\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula. See the Details section below for how to specify
offsets and threshold parameters. For index standardization, you may wish
to include \code{0 + as.factor(year)} (or whatever the time column is called)
in the formula. IID random intercepts are possible using \pkg{lme4}
syntax, e.g., \code{+ (1 | g)} where \code{g} is a column with factor levels.
Penalized splines are possible via \pkg{mgcv}. See examples below.}

\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{spde}{An object from \code{\link[=make_mesh]{make_mesh()}}.}

\item{time}{An optional time column name (as character). Can be left as
\code{NULL} for a model with only spatial random fields unless you wish to use
one of the index or center of gravity functions over time.}

\item{family}{The family and link. Supports \code{\link[=gaussian]{gaussian()}}, \code{\link[=Gamma]{Gamma()}},
\code{\link[=binomial]{binomial()}}, \code{\link[=poisson]{poisson()}}, \code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{Beta()}},
\code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{nbinom2()}}, and
\code{\link[sdmTMB:families]{tweedie()}}]. For binomial family options,
see the 'Binomial families' in the Details section below.}

\item{time_varying}{An optional formula describing covariates that should be
modelled as a random walk through time. Be careful not to include
covariates (including the intercept) in both the main and time-varying
formula. I.e., at least one should have \code{~ 0} or \code{~ -1}.}

\item{weights}{Optional likelihood weights for the conditional model.
Implemented as in \pkg{glmmTMB}. In other words, weights do not have to sum
to one and are not internally modified. Can also be used for trials with
the binomial family. See Details below.}

\item{extra_time}{Optional extra time slices (e.g., years) to include for
interpolation or forecasting with the predict function. See the
Details section below.}

\item{reml}{Logical: use REML (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation
rather than maximum likelihood? Internally, this adds the fixed effects
to the list of random effects to intetgrate over.}

\item{silent}{Silent or include optimization details?}

\item{anisotropy}{Logical: allow for anisotropy? See \code{\link[=plot_anisotropy]{plot_anisotropy()}}.}

\item{control}{Optimization control options. See \code{\link[=sdmTMBcontrol]{sdmTMBcontrol()}}.}

\item{priors}{Optional penalties/priors. See \code{\link[=sdmTMBpriors]{sdmTMBpriors()}}.}

\item{fields}{Estimate the spatiotemporal random fields as \code{"IID"}
(independent and identically distributed; default), stationary \code{"AR1"}
(first-order autoregressive), or as a random walk (\code{"RW"}). Note that the
spatiotemporal standard deviation represents the marginal steady-state
standard deviation of the process in the case of the AR1. I.e., it is
scaled according to the correlation. See the \href{https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/classAR1__t.html}{TMB documentation}. If the AR1
correlation coefficient (rho) is estimated close to 1, say > 0.99, then you
may wish to switch to the random walk \code{"RW"}.}

\item{include_spatial}{Should a separate spatial random field be estimated?
If enabled then there will be separate spatial and spatiotemporal
fields.}

\item{spatial_trend}{Should a separate spatial field be included in the
trend that represents local time trends? Requires spatiotemporal data.
See \doi{10.1111/ecog.05176} and the
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/spatial-trend-models.html}{spatial trends vignette}.}

\item{spatial_only}{Logical: should only a spatial model be fit (i.e., do not
include spatiotemporal random effects)? By default a spatial-only model
will be fit if there is only one unique value in the time column or the
\code{time} argument is left at its default value of \code{NULL}.}

\item{share_range}{Logical: estimate a shared spatial and spatiotemporal
range parameter (\code{TRUE}) or independent range parameters (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{previous_fit}{A previously fitted sdmTMB model to initialize the
optimization with. Can greatly speed up fitting. Note that the data and
model must be set up \emph{exactly} the same way. However, the \code{weights} argument
can change, which can be useful for cross-validation.}

\item{epsilon_predictor}{(Experimental) A column name (as character) of a
predictor of a linear trend (in log space) of the spatiotemporal standard
deviation. By default, this is \code{NULL} and fits a model with a constant
spatiotemporal variance. However, this argument can also be a character
name in the original data frame (a covariate that ideally has been
standardized to have mean 0 and standard deviation = 1). Because the
spatiotemporal field varies by time step, the standardization should be
done by time. If the name of a predictor is included, a log-linear model is
fit where the predictor is used to model effects on the standard deviation,
e.g. \code{log(sd(i)) = B0 + B1 * epsilon_predictor(i)}.}

\item{do_fit}{Fit the model (\code{TRUE}) or return the processed data without
fitting (\code{FALSE})?}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\details{
\strong{Model description}

For now, see the
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html}{model description}
vignette for a start. There are also descriptions of particular models in
Anderson et al. (2019) and Barnett et al. (2020) (see reference list below).

\strong{Offsets}

In the model formula, an offset can be included by including \code{+ offset} in
the model formula (a reserved word). The offset will be included in any
prediction. \code{offset} must be a column in \code{data}.

\strong{Binomial families}
Following the structure of \code{\link[stats:glm]{stats::glm()}} and \pkg{glmmTMB}, a binomial
family can be specified in one of 4 ways: (1) the response may be a factor
(and the model classifies the first level versus all others), (2) the
response may be binomial (0/1), (3) the response can be a matrix of form
\code{cbind(success, failure)}, and (4) the response may be the observed
proportions, and the 'weights' argument is used to specify the Binomial size
(N) parameter (\verb{prob ~ ..., weights = N}).

\strong{Threshold models}

A linear break-point relationship for a covariate can be included via
\code{+ breakpt(variable)} in the formula, where \code{variable} is a single covariate
corresponding to a column in \code{data}. In this case, the relationship is linear
up to a point and then constant.

Similarly, a logistic-function threshold model can be included via
\code{+ logistic(variable)}. This option models the relationship as a logistic
function of the 50\% and 95\% values. This is similar to length- or size-based
selectivity in fisheries, and is parameterized by the points at which f(x) =
0.5 or 0.95. See the vignette.

Note that only a single threshold covariate can be included.

See the
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/threshold-models.html}{threshold vignette}.

\strong{Forecasting or interpolating}

Extra time slices (e.g., years) can be included for interpolation or
forecasting with the predict function via the \code{extra_time} argument. The
predict function requires all time slices to be defined when fitting the
model to ensure the various time indices are set up correctly. Be careful if
including extra time slices that the model remains identifiable. For example,
including \code{+ as.factor(year)} in \code{formula} will render a model with no data
to inform the expected value in a missing year. \code{\link[=sdmTMB]{sdmTMB()}} makes no attempt
to determine if the model makes sense for forecasting or interpolation. The
options \code{time_varying}, \code{fields = "RW"}, and \code{fields = "AR1"}
provide mechanisms to predict over missing time slices with process error.

\strong{Index standardization}

For index standardization, you may wish to include \code{0 + as.factor(year)}
(or whatever the time column is called) in the formula. See a basic
example of index standardization in the relevant
\href{https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html}{package vignette}.
You will need to specify the \code{time} argument. See \code{\link[=get_index]{get_index()}} and/or
\code{\link[=get_index_sims]{get_index_sims()}}.

\strong{Regularization and priors}

You can achieve regularization via penalties (priors) on the fixed effect
parameters. See \code{\link[=sdmTMBpriors]{sdmTMBpriors()}}. These should not include \code{offset} terms and
care should be taken if used with splines. You can fit the model once without
penalties and inspect the element \code{head(your_model$tmb_data$X_ij)} if you
want to see how the formula is translated to the fixed effect model matrix.
