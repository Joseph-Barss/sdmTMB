\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula. An offset can be included by including \code{offset}
in the model formula (a reserved word). The offset will be included in any
prediction. For index standardization, include \code{0 + as.factor(year)} (or
whatever the time column is called) in the formula.}

\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{time}{The time column (as character).}

\item{spde}{An object from \code{\link[=make_spde]{make_spde()}}.}

\item{family}{The family and link. Supports \code{\link[=gaussian]{gaussian()}}, \code{\link[=Gamma]{Gamma()}},
\code{\link[=binomial]{binomial()}}, \code{\link[=poisson]{poisson()}}, \code{\link[=nbinom2]{nbinom2()}}, and \code{\link[=tweedie]{tweedie()}}.}

\item{time_varying}{An optional formula describing covariates that should be
modelled as a random walk through time.}

\item{weights}{Optional likelihood weights for the conditional model.
Implemented as in \pkg{glmmTMB}. In other words, weights do not have to sum
to one and are not internally modified.}

\item{reml}{Logical: use REML estimation rather than maximum likelihood?}

\item{silent}{Silent or include optimization details?}

\item{multiphase}{Logical: estimate the fixed and random effects in phases?
Phases are usually faster and more stable.}

\item{anisotropy}{Logical: allow for anisotropy? See \code{\link[=plot_anisotropy]{plot_anisotropy()}}.}

\item{control}{Optimization control options. See \code{\link[=sdmTMBcontrol]{sdmTMBcontrol()}}.}

\item{enable_priors}{Should weakly informative priors be enabled?
Experimental and likely for use with the \pkg{tmbstan} package. Note that
the priors are not yet sensible and Jacobian adjustments are not made. If you
are interested in this functionality, please contact the developers.}

\item{ar1_fields}{Estimate the spatiotemporal random fields as an AR1
process? Note that the parameter \code{ar1_phi} has been internally bounded
between \code{-1} and \code{1} with:  \code{2 * invlogit(ar1_phi) - 1} i.e. in R \code{2 * plogis(ar_phi) - 1}.}

\item{include_spatial}{Should a separate spatial random field be estimated?
If enabled then there will be a separate spatial field and spatiotemporal
fields.}

\item{spatial_trend}{Should a separate spatial field be included in the
trend? Requires spatiotemporal data.}

\item{normalize}{Logical: should the normalization of the random effects be
done in R during the outer-optimization step? For some cases, especially
with many knots, this may be faster. In others, it may be slower or suffer
from convergence problems. \emph{Currently disabled!}}

\item{spatial_only}{Logical: should only a spatial model be fit (i.e. do not
include spatiotemporal random effects)? By default a spatial-only model
will be fit if there is only one unique value in the time column or the
\code{time} argument is left at its default value of \code{NULL}.}

\item{nlminb_loops}{How many times to run \code{\link[stats:nlminb]{stats::nlminb()}} optimization.
Sometimes restarting the optimizer at the previous best values aids
convergence. If the maximum gradient is still too large,
try increasing this to \code{2}.}

\item{newton_steps}{How many Newton optimization steps to try with
\code{\link[stats:optim]{stats::optimHess()}} after running \code{\link[stats:nlminb]{stats::nlminb()}}. Sometimes aids
convergence.}

\item{mgcv}{Parse the formula with \code{\link[mgcv:gam]{mgcv::gam()}}.}

\item{quadratic_roots}{Logical: should quadratic roots be calculated?
Experimental feature for internal use right now. Note: on the sdmTMB side,
the first two coefficients are used to generate the quadratic parameters.
This means that if you want to generate a quadratic profile for depth, and
depth and depth^2 are part of your formula, you need to make sure these are
listed first and that an intercept isn't included. For example, \code{formula = cpue ~ 0 + depth + depth2 + as.factor(year)}.}
