\title{Update an old sdmTMB model}
\usage{
update_model(object, xy_cols = NULL, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model fitted with \code{\link[=sdmTMB]{sdmTMB()}}.}

\item{xy_cols}{A character vector of x and y column names contained in data
as specified in \code{\link[=make_mesh]{make_mesh()}}. Only needed if the mesh was previously
made with \code{make_spde()}, which did not include the column names.}

\item{silent}{Silent or include optimization details when later fitting?}
}
\description{
If the installed version of sdmTMB is newer than the version that was used to
fit a model, it is possible new parameters have been added to the TMB model
since the model was fit and functions such as \code{print()} or \code{predict()} will
not work. We recommend you fit and predict from an sdmTMB model with the same
version.

You can re-fit the model or you can try running \code{update_model()} on your
older model and saving it to a new model object. This fills in any newer
default TMB data, default TMB parameters, and default TMB map values.
