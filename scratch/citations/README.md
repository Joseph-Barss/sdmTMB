# Build sdmTMB citations list

These are [papers/theses/preprints/reports](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB/blob/main/scratch/citations/citations.md) that use sdmTMB as a modelling platform.

To build the list:

1. Add a reference to the Zotero collection.
1. That collection will auto-export to the .bib files shown here.
1. Source `build.R` in R.
1. That will update the [citations.md](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB/blob/main/scratch/citations/citations.md) file.
